# notes-on-competitive-programming
Some notes and programming exercise from 'Competitve Programming 3'  
  
Up to now the project is divided in notes and ex, ex being the biggest and most relevant part.  
Notes try to summarize the most important concept of the book.  
Ex are taken from UVa website, solved and divided following the book.  
  
No copyright infrangement is intended, this is just a guy trying to learning competitive programming and possibly helps others along the long way.
